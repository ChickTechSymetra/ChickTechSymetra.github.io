        <h1>Testing Definitions</h1>
        <p class="TestType" id="unit">Unit Testing</p>
        <p>Testing of individual software components.</p>
        <p class="TestType" id="usability">
            Usability Testing
        <p>    Testing to determine the extent to which the software product is understood, easy to learn, easy to operate and attractive to the users under specified conditions.

        <p class="TestType" id="integration">Integration Testing</p>
        <p>
            Testing performed to expose defects in the interfaces and in the
            interactions between integrated components or systems.
        </p>

        <p class="TestType" id="system">System/Functional Testing</p>
        <p>
            Testing an integrated system to verify that it meets specified requirements,
            based on an analysis of the specification of the functionality of a component or system.
        </p>

        <p class="TestType" id="security">Security Testing</p>
        <p>
            Testing to validate the security attributes of an application to prevent
            unauthorized access, whether accidental or deliberate, to programs and data.
        </p>

        <p class="TestType" id="compatibility">Compatibility Testing</p>
        <p>
            Non-functional software testing used to ensure compatibility of the system,
            application or website that is built with various other objects such as
            other web browsers, databases, hardware platforms, operating systems, mobile
            devices and networks.
        </p>

        <p class="TestType" id="regression">Regression Test</p>
        <p>
            Testing of a previously tested program following modification to ensure
            that defects have not been introduced or uncovered in unchanged areas of
            the application as a result of the changes made.
        </p>

        <p class="TestType" id="performance">Performance/Load/Stress Testing</p>
        <p>
            Testing to determine the degree to which a system or component accomplishes
            its designated functions regarding processing time and throughput rate.
            This testing may be performed while under heavy load, referred to as Load Testing.
            Stress testing is designed to evaluate the limits of the system and may
            include unusually heavy loads, heavy repetition of certain actions or inputs,
            input of larger numerical values, or large complex queries to a database.
        </p>

        <p class="TestType" id="uat">User Acceptance Testing</p>
        <p>
            Testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes
            conducted to determine whether or not a system satisfies the acceptance
            criteria and to enable the user, customers or other authorized entity to
            determine whether or not to accept the system.
        </p>

        <p class="TestType" id="endtoend">End-to-End Testing</p>
        <p>
            Testing used to validate that the flow of an application is performing as
            designed from start to finish, to identify system dependencies, and to
            ensure that the right information is passed between various system components and systems.
        </p>

        <p class="TestType" id="build">Build Verification Testing</p>
        <p>
            Testing to validate that the most crucial functions of a program have been
            properly implemented.  Contains a subset of defined/planned test cases
            that cover the main functionality of a component or system.
