        <h3>Basic Concepts for Software testers</h3>
        <div style="text-align: left;">
        <p><br/>SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time.
        SDLC includes a detailed plan for how to develop, alter, maintain, and replace a software system.</p>
        
        <p>SDLC involves several distinct stages, including planning, design, building, testing, and deployment. Popular SDLC models
        include the waterfall model, spiral model, and Agile model.<br/><br/></p>
        <h3>Stages and Best Practices of SDLC</h3>
        <p>Following the best practices and/or stages of SDLC ensures the process works in a smooth, efficient, and productive way.</p>
        <ol class="Quiz">
          <li><strong>Identify the current problems</strong>. “What don’t we want?” This stage of SDLC means getting input from all stakeholders, including customers,
          salespeople, industry experts, and programmers. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of the current system with improvement as the goal.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan</strong>. “What do we want?” In this stage of SDLC, the team defines the requirements of the new software and determines the cost and
          resources required. It also details the risks involved and provides sub-plans for softening those risks. In this stage, a Software
          Requirement Specification document is created.</li>
          <li><strong>Design</strong>. “How will we get what we want?” This phase of SDLC starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan called the
          Design Specification. All stakeholders then review this plan and offer feedback and suggestions. It’s crucial to have a plan for collecting
          and incorporating stakeholder input into this document. Failure at this stage will almost certainly result in cost overruns at best and
          total collapse of the project at worst.</li>
          <li><strong>Build</strong>. “Let’s create what we want.” This SDLC stage develops the software by generating all the actual code. If the previous steps
          have been followed with attention to detail, this is actually the least complicated step.</li>
          <li><strong>Test</strong>. “Did we get what we want?” In this stage, we test for defects and deficiencies. We fix those issues until the product meets the
          original specifications.</li>
          <li><strong>Deploy</strong>. “Let’s start using what we got.” Often, this part of the SDLC process happens in a limited way at first. Depending on feedback
          from end users, more adjustments can be made.</li>
          <li><strong>Maintain</strong>. “Let’s get this closer to what we want.” The plan almost never turns out perfect when it meets reality. Further, as conditions
          in the real world change, we need to update and advance the software to match.</li>
