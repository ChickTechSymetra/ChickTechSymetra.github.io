    <p>We'll be using two tools that are already loaded on your laptop: GitHub Desktop, and Komodo Edit.  </p>
    <p>First, we'll create an account with GitHub.  (Unless you already have one.)  Note: you will need
        an email address that you can access to confirm your account.)
       Git is a cloud repository for you code, that will also let you publish a simple website for free.</p>
    <p><span class='Step'>1</span>Go to https://github.com/, and click the button to
    <span class='greenButton'>Sign up for GitHub</span><br/><br/></p>
    <p><span class='Step'>2</span>Create an account.  Your username will be the name on your website, so consider what you would like...

        <div style='margin-left: 75px'>GirlsLoveTech ?</div>
        <div style='margin-left: 75px'>MyNameOnTheWeb ?</div><br/>
        <div style='margin-left: 50px'>Have some fun with this!</div></p>
    <img  style='margin-left: 50px' src='images/SignUp.PNG' alt='GitUpSignUpSample'  />
    <p><span class='Step'>3</span>Choose 'Unlimited public repositories for free', and click Continue.  </p>
    <img style='margin-left: 50px' src='images/Free.png' alt='Unlimited Plan' />
    <p style='margin-left: 50px'>On the next page,  you can fill in your experience, or just skip it and click <span class='greenButton'> Submit </span></p><br/><br/>
    <p><span class='Step'>4</span>You'll need to go to your email address and verify the account.  Just click the link
        that GitHub sends you.<br/><br/></p>
    <p><span class='Step'>5</span>Now that we have an account, we'll need to set it up.  Go to <a href='https://GitHub.com' target='_blank'>https://GitHub.com</a>, and sign in.<br/>
    </p><br/>
    <p><span class='Step'>6</span>You'll be asked to create a Repository, where your web pages will be stored.  This step is very important!  You can have lots
    of repositories, but you can only have one that will publish to your own website.  That repository name needs to be your <strong>Username.github.io</strong></p>
    <img style='margin-left: 50px'  src='images/Repo.png' alt='Creating a repository' />
    
    <p><span class='Step'>7</span>Done?  OK, now we're going to switch to your machine, where we already have
      your commands set up.  On your laptop, go to C:\WorkshopFiles.  There is a file there called SetUpGit that
      we need to edit.</p>
    <img style='margin-left: 50px'  src="images/Files.png" alt='Right-click on SetUpGit.cmd' /><br/>
    <p><span class='Step'>8</span>On the fifth line in the file, there are two places where is says "UserName".  Change
    this to your actual Username that you set up in Git Hub.  Then save and close the file.</p>
    <img  style='margin-left: 50px' src="images/EditCommand.png" alt='file details' /></br><br/><br/>
    <p><span class='Step'>9</span>Now run the file by double-clicking it.  Did it work?<br/><br/></p>
    <p><span class='Step'>10</span>Last step: Go back to GitHub and click on your username.  It should refresh the page,
    and list the files we've added.</p>
    <img style='margin-left: 50px'  src="images/ClickToRefresh.png" alt='file details' /></br><br/>
    <p class="todo">To do: Make the previous pic smaller, and add a pic with all the files they should see</p>
    <p>Wow, that was a lot to set up.  But now we can have some fun.</p>
