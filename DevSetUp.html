    <p>We'll be using two tools that are already loaded on your laptop: GitHub Desktop, and Komodo Edit.  </p>
    <p>First, we'll create an account with GitHub.  (Unless you already have one.)  Note: you will need
        an email address that you can access to confirm your account.)
       Git is a cloud repository for you code, that will also let you publish a simple website for free.</p>
    <p><span class='Step'>1</span>Go to https://github.com/, and click the button to
    <span style='background-color: #28a745; color: white;padding: 5px;border-radius: 5px;'>Sign up for GitHub</span><br/><br/></p>
    <p><span class='Step'>2</span>Create an account.  Your username will be the name on your website, so consider what you would like...<br/>

    Have some fun with this!</p>

    <p><span class='Step'>3</span>Choose 'Unlimited public repositories for free', and click Continue.</p>
    <img src='images/Free.png' alt='Unlimited Plan' />
    <p><span class='Step'>4</span>You'll need to go to your email address and verify the account.  Just click the link
        that GitHub sends you.<br/><br/></p>
    <p><span class='Step'>5</span>Now that we have an account, we'll need to set it up.  Go to GitHub.com, and sign in.<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <p><span class='Step'>6</span>On the left side is a menu.  We want the item 'Repositories'.  </p>
    <img src='images/Repositories.png' alt='Menu' />
    <p><span class='Step'>7</span>Click 'create one' to create a new repository.</p>
    <img src="images/NoRepositories.png" />
    <p><span class='Step'>8</span>OK, now we're going to switch to your machine, where we already have
      your commands set up.  On your laptop, go to C:\WorkshopFiles.  There is a file there called SetUpGit that
      we need to edit.</p>
    <img src="images/Files.png" alt='Right-click on SetUpGit.cmd' />
    <p><span class='Step'>9</span>On the fifth line in the file, there are two places where is says "UserName".  Change
    this to your actual Username that you set up in Git Hub.  Then save and close the file.</p>
    <img src="images/EditCommand.png" alt='file details' />
    <p><span class='Step'>10</span>Now run the file by double-clicking it.  Did it work?<br/><br/></p>
    <p><span class='Step'>11</span>Last step: Go back to GitHub and click on your username.  It should refresh the page,
    and list the files we've added.</p>
    <img src="images/ClickToRefresh.png" alt='file details' />
    
    <p>Wow, that was a lot to set up.  But now, we can have some fun.</p>
    <p class="todo">Did this work?  Because originally I had to download Git, but that's because I set things up
     before GitHub Desktop, so I'm hoping GitHub Desktop takes care of this.  Also, did it ask where on
     the harddrive to point to?  </p>
    <p><a href='images/DevSetup2.html'>Next: Let's add some files</a></p>

 <p class="todo" style="margin-top: 25px;">To Do: Add additional instructions to do this from home, since they won't have
    the Git, Git Desktop, and Komodo software pre-loaded.  Center this text
    on the page.</p>
