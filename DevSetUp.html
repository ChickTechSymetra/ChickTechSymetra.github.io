    <p>First, we'll create an account with GitHub.  (Unless you already have one.)  Note: you will need
        an email address that you can access to confirm your account.)
       Git is a cloud repository for you code, that will also let you publish a simple website for free.</p>
    <p>1.  Go to https://github.com/, and click the button to
    <span style='background-color: #28a745; color: white;padding: 5px;border-radius: 5px;'>Sign up for GitHub</span></p>
    <p>2.  Create an account.  Your username will be the name on your website, so consider what you would like...<br/>

    Have some fun with this!</p>

    <p>3.  Choose 'Unlimited public repositories for free', and click Continue.</p>

    <p>4.  You'll need to go to your email address and verify the account.  Just click the link
        that GitHub sends you.</p>
    <p>5.  Now that we have an account, we'll need to set it up.  Go to GitHub.com, and sign in.
    </p>
    <p>6.  On the left side is a menu.  We want the item 'Repositories'. [highlight link in pic]  </p>
    <img src='images/Repositories.png' alt='Menu' />
    <p>7.  Click 'create one' to create a new repository.</p>
    <img src="NoRepositories.png" />
    <p>8.  We're going to use the Quick setup.  But here's the IMPORTANT part: you want the URL to be exactly
    your username.git.io.git
    Then click the button to 'Set up in Desktop'. [highlight button in pic]</p>
    <img src="QuickSetup.png" />
    <p>9.  That should have opened an application called GitHub Desktop.  </p>
    <p>Wow, that was a lot to set up.  But now, we can have some fun.</p>
