    <div style='margin: 30px;'>
    <p>We'll be using two tools that are already loaded on your laptop: GitHub Desktop, and Komodo Edit.  </p>
    <p>First, we'll create an account with GitHub.  (Unless you already have one.)  Note: you will need
        an email address that you can access to confirm your account.)
       Git is a cloud repository for you code, that will also let you publish a simple website for free.</p>
    <p><span class='Step'>1</span>Go to https://github.com/, and click the button to
    <span style='background-color: #28a745; color: white;padding: 5px;border-radius: 5px;'>Sign up for GitHub</span><br/><br/></p>
    <p><span class='Step'>2</span>Create an account.  Your username will be the name on your website, so consider what you would like...<br/>

    Have some fun with this!</p>

    <p><span class='Step'>3</span>Choose 'Unlimited public repositories for free', and click Continue.</p>
    <img src='images/Free.png' alt='Unlimited Plan' />
    <p><span class='Step'>4</span>You'll need to go to your email address and verify the account.  Just click the link
        that GitHub sends you.<br/><br/></p>
    <p><span class='Step'>5</span>Now that we have an account, we'll need to set it up.  Go to GitHub.com, and sign in.<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <p><span class='Step'>6</span>On the left side is a menu.  We want the item 'Repositories'.  </p>
    <img src='images/Repositories.png' alt='Menu' />
    <p><span class='Step'>7</span>Click 'create one' to create a new repository.</p>
    <img src="images/NoRepositories.png" />
    <p><span class='Step'>8</span>We're going to use the Quick setup.  But here's the IMPORTANT part: you want the URL to be exactly
    your username.github.io   
    Then click the button to 'Set up in Desktop'. </p>
    <img src="images/QuickSetup.png" />
    <p><span class='Step'>9</span>That should have opened an application called GitHub Desktop.  </p>
    <p>Wow, that was a lot to set up.  But now, we can have some fun.</p>
    <p class="todo">Did this work?  Because originally I had to download Git, but that's because I set things up
     before GitHub Desktop, so I'm hoping GitHub Desktop takes care of this.  Also, did it ask where on
     the harddrive to point to?  </p>

 <p class="todo" style="margin-top: 25px;">To Do: Add additional instructions to do this from home, since they won't have
    the Git, Git Desktop, and Komodo software pre-loaded.  Use some cool number icons for the steps, and center this text
    on the page.</p>
